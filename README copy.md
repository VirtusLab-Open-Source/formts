# FormTs

### Why another lib?

### Goals:

- fully type-safe
- declarative API
- high performance
- minimal size
- separation of form logic from form presentation
- minimal API surface

### API Proposals

- A
- B
- C

### Roadmap

1. ~~**Research**~~
   What are other solutions and their problems?

2. **API design**
   What should be the features and public API of the lib?

3. **API PoC**
   Implement the form builder and typing behind public API to prove it works.

4. **Alpha version**  
   First working version (perhaps using Formik under the hood)

5. **Beta version**  
   Full implementation

6. **1.0**  
   Polishing, testing, documentation, benchmarks...
